<!DOCTYPE html><head><meta charset="utf-8" /><title>About! — Notes</title></head><body><h1>Notes</h1><h2>About!</h2><h3>by Sameer Gupta — Mon 06 November 2023</h3><div><p>Recently, I could focus and  ve made some progress in managing my auth secrets, gpg and automating
some git with this together with bash and nix, with emacs as $EDITOR, thanks to flake and
home-manager.</p><p>In process of adding a guix overlay to to my nix config, as I needed guile[^1] to use haunt for
this place along with forgefed (activitypub based git forge) and the I can abandon this place.</p><p>At the same time I am putting a nix flake together to stabelize my orgmode (finally)</p><p>Thats my flow with tools, I don't put time because I know something, but when it's useful in
everyday desk issues, which changes and  do the tools..</p><p>I learnt this from market (not a rosy experience), they appreciate the good , but invest in purpose.
Exception to this are</p><ul><li><p>Curry paradox and Curry Howard Isomorphism</p><ul><li>The latter gives an equivalance between something stationary (proof) and something dynamic
(program).</li><li>It questions the relational model of motion, like newton's rotating bucket paradox does and
binds the work of programming to the pursuit of logic and pure math</li></ul></li><li>Nix is an interesting juncture tooling for tooling friction in actually doing it, theory, takes
time and effort</li></ul><p>So This an interesting meta-inflection point in this context of my long term note taking and
referencing habit on interent
[^1]: while orgmode is way more maximalist and simpler than a doc programming framework, skribolo
markup is closer to scheme and I plan to use it along with markdown, guile is in nixpkgs , guix is
not. Besides, I came across the work of Xi Iaso-nix, Andre van Meulebrouck's conversion from Scheme
to Haskell, which sets the direction for now.Org is notorious for breaking with versions, but that
is something nix can look after</p></div></body>
