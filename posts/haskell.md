This post doesn't deal much with the GHC-toolkit, but with introductry application of the  very
basic ideas of
- lambda calculus
- {SKI}/Y- combinators [^1]
- from the category of sets to types,functors, monads
  - singleton , union
- church encodings and boolean algebra

To the following Haskell data structure manipulations useful in writing a non/deterministic programs

-  `traverse` a tree
- `concat` or `fmap`  a list

[^1]: Y-combinator for using iterations,recursion in the calculus
